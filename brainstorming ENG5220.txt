-automatic light dimmer/controler
-temperature controlled fan
-object tracking camera/software
-touch capacitive sensor to actuate light (real time dsp)
-

try make it something that ppl actually want to use
software interrupts are a big thing (not just constant reading of sensors)
2-3 sensors working together or 1 sensors doing something more complex


new ideas:
- synthesizer
- reach out bot (cannot see how this is real time)
- maze solving robot
- ambulance sounds turn traffic ligths green -> transmitter/receiver
- whistle sensoring for pressure cooker
- cane with circuitry that turns pedestrian lights green faster for longer


ambulance sounds turn traffic ligths green -> transmitter/receiver
->receivers only arm/turn on when sound of siren is heard (specific frequency)
->rf transmission should happen at a quick pace (ambulance is moving at high speeds)


Idea#1
Ambulance rf transmitter

Idea#2
Cane rf transmitter->Card for elderly people (many more use cases)

Idea#3
Home automation (motion+temp sensors, potentiometers, etc)

Idea#4
Fingerprint sensor identifier for music playback (user interface needed to add more users and their respective preferences)
->incorporate blower for wet clothes/shoes

Idea#5
Pressure cooker

one touch cozy night
cozy mood made easy
add a jazzy touch

---Hardware needed
>fingerprint sensor (rasp pi compatible)
>rgb led light strip (possibly power too)
>speaker system (cheapest one, 3.5mm jack) --> nishant may has one we can use!
>mutliple plug extension

user enters different playlists for different days/time of day
user picks color for each playlist
upon user creation, web app prompts user for initial scan for registration and correlation
